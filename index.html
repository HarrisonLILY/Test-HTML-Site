            <h1 class="fw-bold">The Lionâ€™s New Look</h1>
            <p>
              Leo was a lion who lived in the savanna with his pride. He was the
              king of the animals, and he was proud of his majestic mane and his
              powerful roar. He liked to hunt, nap, and play with his friends,
              but he also had a secret passion: he loved fashion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Leo liked to try on different outfits and accessories that he
              found in the human villages nearby. He had a collection of hats,
              scarves, sunglasses, and even shoes that he hid in his den. He
              enjoyed dressing up and looking at himself in the water, but he
              never showed his new look to anyone else. He was afraid that they
              would laugh at him or think that he was not a real lion.
            </p>
            <p>
              One day, Leo found something that he had never seen before: a
              cowboy hat and a tutu. He was curious and excited. He put on the
              hat and the tutu and admired himself in the water. He felt like a
              star. He decided to go for a walk and show off his new look to the
              other animals.
            </p>
            <p>
              He walked past the zebras, the giraffes, the elephants, and the
              monkeys. They all stared at him in disbelief and amusement. They
              whispered and giggled behind his back. Leo heard them and felt
              hurt. He thought they would like his new look, but they only made
              fun of him.
            </p>
            <p>
              He reached the edge of the savanna, where he saw a group of
              hyenas. They saw him too, and they smelled an opportunity. They
              thought that Leo was weak and silly. They decided to attack him
              and take his territory.
            </p>
            <p>
              They ran towards him, snarling and snapping their teeth. Leo was
              scared. He realized that he had made a mistake. He wished he had
              never put on the hat and the tutu. He wished he had stayed with
              his pride.
            </p>
            <p>
              He turned around and ran back to his den. He hoped that his
              friends would help him fight off the hyenas. He hoped that they
              would still accept him as their king.
            </p>
            <p>
              He reached his den and saw his pride waiting for him. They had
              heard his roar of distress and came to his rescue. They saw him
              wearing the hat and the tutu, but they did not care. They loved
              him for who he was, not for what he wore.
            </p>
            <p>
              They charged at the hyenas, who were surprised and scared by their
              sudden appearance. They fought bravely and fiercely, until they
              drove the hyenas away.
            </p>
            <p>
              Leo thanked his friends for saving him. He apologized for leaving
              them and for hiding his passion from them. He told them that he
              liked fashion, but he also liked being a lion.
            </p>
            <p>
              His friends hugged him and told him that they understood. They
              told him that he could wear whatever he wanted, as long as he was
              happy and confident. They told him that he was still their king,
              and their friend.
            </p>
            <p>
              Leo smiled and felt relieved. He realized that he did not have to
              choose between being a lion and being fashionable. He could be
              both.
            </p>
            <p>
              He took off the hat and the tutu and gave them to his friends as
              gifts. They tried them on and laughed together. They looked silly,
              but they did not care.
            </p>
            <p>
              They went back to their normal activities, hunting, napping, and
              playing together. But every once in a while, they would dress up
              and have fun with their new look.
            </p>
            <p>
              They were happy lions, who loved each other for who they were.
            </p>
